nginx module based on a basic c lib
===================================

This is an experiment to build a simple nginx module based on the basic C lib project I wrote to reuse on small experiments. You can find the basic C lib at https://github.com/moret/basic_c_lib . In the same fashion, this project is also full of the old MS "my_this" and "my_that" to make sure you will get mad at it and rename everything.

:: requirements ::

This project supposes you're using the basic C lib from https://github.com/moret/basic_c_lib on the same folder level as the module. Also, the instructions assume you have downloaded nginx source to another folder and will build nginx from there:

dev-projects/
├── basic_c_lib/
├── nginx-1.3.6/
└── ngx_basic_c_lib_based_module/

Also you need to install a few gems to run tests. Just run bundle install. Using RVM as usual is recommended.

Of course, you need GCC, make and all the basic C libs. Usually a build-essentials package should be enough.

:: how to use ::

I suppose you too will use it to bootstrap other modules. So you should first clone it, detach it from this repository, rename it as you wish and add it to your own git repo. Something like:

git clone git@github.com:moret/ngx_basic_c_lib_based_module.git
rm -rf ngx_basic_c_lib_based_module/.git
mv ngx_basic_c_lib_based_module ngx_cool_module
git init ngx_cool_module

:: building with nginx crash course ::

First you should build the lib. You can see how it's done on the lib project - it's something like make lib.

If your folders are on different names, you will need to setup the config file. Otherwise you just need to compile nginx with the module. There are good guides on how to compile it with modules. I recommend you look for them, but don't be scared as they will always boil down to something like this:

- Download and uncompress nginx code
- Run configure with --add-module pointing to your module
- Run make, make install with your lib LIBRARY_PATH

Ex.:

export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/dev-projects/basic_c_lib/
./configure --with-ld-opt='-L/usr/local/lib' --with-cc-opt='-I/usr/local/include' --add-module=../ngx_basic_c_lib_based_module --prefix=/home/user/dev-projects/nginx-1.3.6
make -j2
make install
sudo /home/user/nginx-1.3.6/dev-projects/sbin/nginx

Having your own nginx builder script is recommended. Take a look at https://github.com/moret/nginx-builder-utils .

:: developing ::

Build nginx with the module as shown above. Then link its binary here:

ln -s /home/user/dev-projects/nginx-1.3.6/sbin/nginx

And run rspec. After that you're on your own.

Bye!
